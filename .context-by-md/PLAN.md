## How To Use This File

**Claude maintains this file by:**
1. Moving tasks between status sections as work progresses
2. Checking off subtasks as they're completed
3. Adding new tasks discovered during work
4. Updating "Blocked by" notes when dependencies arise

**Finding ready work:**
1. Look for 🟢 items (no blockers)
2. Sort by priority (P0 > P1 > P2 > P3)
3. Pick the highest priority ready item

**On session start:** Claude scans for 🟢 items and continues highest priority.

**Dependency tracking:** Use "Blocked by:" notes. When blocker resolves, change 🔴 to 🟢.
