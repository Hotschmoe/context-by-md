# Context Start

Read and internalize the current project context to continue work effectively.

## Instructions

1. **Read CURRENT.md** to understand:
   - Active focus (what we're working on)
   - Immediate next steps
   - Critical context that must not be lost
   - Key resources

2. **Read PLAN.md** to understand:
   - Current epic and its goal
   - Ready tasks ([READY]) sorted by priority
   - Blocked tasks and their blockers
   - Recently completed work

3. **Skim BACKLOG.md** for:
   - Any high-priority bugs that should be promoted
   - Context about technical debt

4. **Orient and report:**
   - Summarize current state in 2-3 sentences
   - Identify the highest-priority ready task
   - Ask if you should continue that task or if the user has other plans

## After Reading

Update CURRENT.md "Session Notes" with:
```markdown
## [...] Session Notes

**Session started:** [timestamp]
**Continuing from:** [last session summary if visible]
**Plan:** [what you intend to work on]
```
