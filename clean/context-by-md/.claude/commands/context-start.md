# Context Start

Read project context to continue work effectively.

## Steps

1. **Read CURRENT.md** - Active focus, next steps, critical context
2. **Read PLAN.md** - Active Sprint tasks, find highest priority [READY]
3. **Skim BACKLOG.md** - Any high-priority bugs to promote?

## After Reading

Report in 2-3 sentences:
- Current state summary
- Highest priority ready task
- Ask: continue that task or different plans?

Update CURRENT.md Session Notes:
```markdown
## [...] Session Notes
**Started:** [timestamp] | **Continuing:** [last session summary]
**Plan:** [what you'll work on]
```
