# Markdown Context System

A lightweight alternative to beads using plain markdown files and Claude Code hooks.

## Philosophy

Beads is powerful but complex (Go binary, SQLite + JSONL, daemon, git hooks, etc.). 
This system achieves 80% of the value with 20% of the complexity by using:
- Plain markdown files (human-readable, git-friendly)
- Claude Code slash commands for context management
- Simple conventions Claude follows via CLAUDE.md instructions

## Directory Structure

```
.context-by-md/
├── CURRENT.md              # Active context - Claude reads this on every session
├── PLAN.md                 # Current action plan with tasks
├── BACKLOG.md              # Future work, discovered issues, ideas
├── sessions/
│   ├── 2026-01-08_1430.md  # Session logs (auto-generated)
│   └── ...
└── archive/
    └── 2026-01/            # Archived/compacted old sessions
```

## Quick Start

### One-Line Install

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hotschmoe/context-by-md/master/install-remote.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hotschmoe/context-by-md/master/install-remote.ps1 | iex
```

### Manual Install

1. Copy `.context-by-md/` to your project root
2. Copy `.claude/commands/` hooks to your project
3. Add `.context-by-md/sessions/` and `.context-by-md/archive/` to `.gitignore` (optional)
4. Tell Claude: "Read .context-by-md/CURRENT.md before starting work"

## File Purposes

### CURRENT.md - The Active Bead
This is what Claude reads on compaction/session start. Contains:
- What we're working on RIGHT NOW
- Immediate next steps
- Critical context that must not be lost
- Links to relevant files/resources

### PLAN.md - Structured Task Tracking  
Replaces beads' dependency graph with a simple hierarchy:
- Epics (## headers)
- Tasks (### headers with checkboxes)
- Subtasks (nested checkboxes)
- Status markers: [BLOCKED], [WIP], [READY], [DONE]

### BACKLOG.md - Discovered Work
Where Claude files things it notices but aren't immediate:
- Bugs discovered during work
- Technical debt
- Future improvements
- Ideas and notes

### sessions/*.md - Session Logs
Auto-generated by hooks. Contains:
- What was accomplished
- Decisions made
- Problems encountered
- Context for future sessions

## vs Beads: Trade-offs

### What You Lose
- Automated "ready work" queries (`bd ready`)
- Hash-based IDs for multi-agent collision avoidance
- Formal dependency tracking (`blocks`, `discovered-from`)
- Compaction with LLM summarization
- Multi-repo coordination
- Real-time daemon sync

### What You Gain
- Zero dependencies (no Go binary, no npm package)
- Human-readable everything
- Works offline, no daemon
- Easy to customize
- No learning curve for contributors
- Git diffs are meaningful
- Can use any text editor
- Portable across AI tools (not Claude-specific)

## Verdict

**Use this system when:**
- Solo developer or small team
- Want simplicity over features
- Don't need multi-agent coordination
- Prefer human-readable formats
- Quick prototyping or personal projects

**Use beads when:**
- Large team with multiple agents
- Need formal dependency tracking
- Want automated compaction
- Multi-repo workflows
- Need ready-work queries
